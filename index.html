        From Emmy Award winner Dick Wolf and the team behind the Law & Order franchise, FBI is a fast-paced drama
        about
        the inner workings of the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This elite unit brings to
        bear
        all their talents, intellect and technical expertise on major cases in order to keep New York and the country
        safe. Born into a multigenerational law enforcement family, Special Agent Maggie Bell commits deeply to the
        people
        she works with as well as those she protects. Her partner is Special Agent Omar Adom "OA" Zidan.
